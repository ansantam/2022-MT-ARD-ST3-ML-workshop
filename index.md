# Introductory machine learning tutorials for accelerator physicists
## About
These tutorials were first used for the [2022 MT ARD ST3 pre-meeting Machine Learning Workshop](https://indico.desy.de/event/35272/)
, part of the [10th MT ARD ST3 Meeting 2022 in Berlin](https://indico.desy.de/event/33584/).

## Getting started
First, download anaconda and install it: https://www.anaconda.com/

```
git clone https://github.com/ansantam/2022-MT-ARD-ST3-ML-workshop.git
cd 2022-MT-ARD-ST3-ML-workshop
./setup.sh
conda activate mt-ard-st3-ml-workshop
jupyter notebook
```

You are now ready to execute the workshop notebooks.
