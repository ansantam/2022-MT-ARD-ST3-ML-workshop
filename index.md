# Introductory machine learning tutorials for accelerator physicists
## About
These tutorials were first used for the [2022 MT ARD ST3 pre-meeting Machine Learning Workshop](https://indico.desy.de/event/35272/)
, part of the [10th MT ARD ST3 Meeting 2022 in Berlin](https://indico.desy.de/event/33584/).

## Getting started
- Log in one of the room PCs with the username and password provided on the piece of paper that we gave you
- Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
cd 2022-MT-ARD-ST3-ML-workshop
git pull
conda activate /data/scratch/2022-MLW/mt-ard-st3-mlw/
jupyter notebook
```

You are now ready to execute the workshop notebooks. ðŸŽ‰
