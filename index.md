# Introductory machine learning tutorials for accelerator physicists
## About
These tutorials were first used for the [2022 MT ARD ST3 pre-meeting Machine Learning Workshop](https://indico.desy.de/event/35272/)
, part of the [10th MT ARD ST3 Meeting 2022 in Berlin](https://indico.desy.de/event/33584/).

## Getting started
As a prerequisite for this workshop, please install *Anaconda*. You can refer to the ![Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) for instructions.

With Anaconda installed, run the following command in the workshop directory to create the environment for the workshop.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Then start the Jupyter Notebook by running

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You are now ready to execute the workshop notebooks. ðŸŽ‰
